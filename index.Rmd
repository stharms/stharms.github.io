I'm currently a graduate student in the Statistics Department at Iowa State University. I graduated from the University of Kansas in 2016 with a B.S. in Mathematics and Economics, and I'm also a proud graduate of Newton High School in Newton, KS.

If you've made it this far you're almost certainly on your way out of this site. Here's some other more fun(?) places you can go on the internet and find me present:

-To my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-harms-ab46236b/)

-To my mostly empty [github repo](https://github.com/stharms)

-To what I'm [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42417708-st-harms)

-To what I'm [listening to](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/user/stharms/)
